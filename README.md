# Physics
![screen](data/screen.png) <br>
It's a model body thrown at angle to the horizon taking into account air resistance. Air resistance is calculated according to the formula
![formula](data/Formula.gif) <br>
`k` = Cx * S <br>
`Cx` - coefficient of resistance <br>
`S` - the cross-sectional area <br>
`p` - the density of the air <br>
`V` - current speed <br>
You can configure the all values

# Charts
`H(S)` – The trajectory of the body. This chart doesn't have tracker (see below) <br>
`H(t)` – Height above the ground <br>
`S(t)` – Distance <br>
`V(t)` – Velocity <br>
`Vx(t)` – Velocity along the Xaxis <br>
`Vy(t)` – Velocity along the Yaxis <br>
`A(t)` – Acceleration <br>
`Ax(t)` – Acceleration along the Xaxis <br>
`Ay(t)` – Acceleration along the Yaxis <br>

# Zooming and scrolling
All charts have the same viewing range at the time(except the first one) for ease using. To automatically scale press `A` or `Home` in the chart window. <br>
<b>Scrolling</b> is a LMB and <b>zoom</b> is the mouse wheel.

# Tracker
Also you can see the values of the body parameters in a certain period of time. For this there is a blue time bar which you can LMB to move.

# Planets
In the application there is choice of the planet. When you press on the button, `g` and the `density of the air` set for this planet.

# Table Information
For easely for use there is a basic information. You can set the tracker on the end time or on the rise time of the lifting body. To do this, click on the appropriate label time.
